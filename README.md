# Horiseon - In the Pursuit of Web Accessibility

The following is a webpage of HoriSEOn, subjected to a variety of accessibility measures, such as:

* Ran accessibility test through: https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://f34rth3r34p3r.github.io/HoriseonAccessibility/ and determined that there was low contrast in the `<aside>` element. Changed color of `"benefits"` div to #0072bb, darkening it to increase contrast ratio. 
* Added accessibility links to top of page, invisible to sighted visiters but accessible to keyboard-only users and screen-readers.
* Collaped and consolidated multiple CSS selectors into more concise terms; updated `<div>` ids accordingly.
* Adding alt-text for all large or meaningful images.
* Adding empty alt-text brackets `alt=""` for small icons to prevent the screen-reader from reading it and to avoid confusing the person using it.
* Changing `<div>` elements to more semantic and human/SEO-friendly tags, such as `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.
